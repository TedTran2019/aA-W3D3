Lots to learn from W3D2's AA Questions bonus section. 
Instructor's solution: model_base.rb
1. Reflective programming
2. Inflector methods for string, tableize
3. Database class methods
4. Interpolation instead of ?
5. Usage of splat operator for unlimited arguments
6. instance_variables instance method
7. DRY - Don't repeat yourself
SQL queries return arrays! -> Even if it's a single thing or nothing at all

RoR(Ruby on Rails) -> web application framework written in Ruby, released in 2004.

MVC - Model-view-controller design pattern that divides an application into 
3 basic parts.
1. Model concerned with retrieval of information from storage/logic done to said info 
2. View is concerned with presenting information 
3. Controller constructs server's HTTP response and sends commands to model 
to fetch/update information, and to view to display information. Acts 
as interface between model and view

CoC - convention over configuration. Only need to be specific about doing 
something unconventional. Circumvents writing boilerplate configuration
1. cats database table -> Cat model/class -> CatsController

REST -> Representational State Transfer, architectural style for web services. 
RESTful web service -> access web resources using standard operations aka 
HTTP's GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE. 
Ex. GET request to resource with ID will return data on the item.
RESTful web services are stateless-- each request/response cycle is independent
of any other and information will not be retained. Data cached on client side.
Rails defaults to RESTful API using resources method, automatically
generates routes by linking HTTP verbs and URLs to controller actions 

ActiveRecord -> ORM, represents data from database as Ruby objects. Contains 
methods to implement basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete)

ActionController -> handles controller logic, access to various cookies, 
provides protection against CSRF attcks by checking authenticity tokens

ActionView -> responsible for rendering views, templates can take several forms.
ERB aka embedded ruby, aka HTML with Ruby. Builder file: instead of rendering 
HTML, a view could render XML or JSON

Rake -> utility tool packaged with Rails that handles task management, 
scripting tool for Rails

Rack -> middleware tht sits between Rails router and the web server, 
receiving HTTP requests from the server and generating responses using 
information from the router.Rack ensures every server can interface 
with eevery framework.

WEBrick -> HTTP server that's standard with Rails 4, Rails 5 ships with Puma.
WEBrick is single-threaded, aka 1 request at a time. Puma is fast, multi-threaded, 
and handles requests concurrently.

Sinatra -> smaller/simpler than Rails 

Node.js (Javascript) -> part of MEAN stack (Mongo.db, Express.js, Angular.js, 
and Node.js) to create a full-stack app. Node is a runtime environment, not a 
framework. (Can run JS code, has packages called modules, very flexible)

Django (Python) -> MVC framework, explicit > implicit

Spring MVC (Java) -> Can be very slow, has to be completely restarted, 
lack of scalability, any kind of I/O holds up a thread and slows down the app 

Play! (Scala) -> supports hot reload unlike Spring, more built-in functionality, 
and is much more responsive. Lack of plug-ins, but it's a very fast language.

ASP.NET MVC (.NET) -> Microsoft, C# supported, suited for Windows development.
Preference: Ruby vs C# or other .NET languages?

Laravel(PHP) -> most popular server-side language in use is PHP, developed 
w/ modern architecture in mind. Support for user authentication, recurring 
billing services, scheduling periodically executed tasks, etc
--------------------------------------

rails new project_name -d=database_name

Gem file! -> Version included, gems installed in certain environments...
3 environments: Development, test, and production
bundle install to install said gems
pry-rails is useful!

Database migrations -> a migration is a file containing Ruby code that 
describes a set of changes applied to the db

bundle exec rails db:create -> Create the database defined in config
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby-on-rails/rails-migrations.htm

bundle exec rails generate migration <name> -> Makes migration
createTable -> auto-loads boilerplate code

create_table :table_name do |t|
  t.type "etc", 
end

bundle exec rails db:migrate -> Migrates!
bundle exec rails db:migrate:status -> Tells what has been migrated

How to change migrations?
Just make another migration and add or remove a column! 

bundle exec rails db:rollback will rollback the latest migration -> Do 
not ever do this in production. If possible, do not EVER rollback to avoid 
it becoming a habit

ORM -> translate between SQL records and Ruby/etc objects

In model, make a model class like for dogs table, Dog class, and inherit 
from ApplicationRecord
Get methods like .all, .last, .create(options), .destroy, .column_names, .new, .save, 
getter/setter methods, .first, .find(id), find_by(options), destroy_all, where, etc.

gem 'annotate' -> bundle exec annotate -> prints out schema for models
Validations: 
bundle exec rails console -> Kinda like pry but with everything loaded
.save! will raise exception, while .save will just return false
.errors.full_messages -> stores errors
.valid? will ask if it's a valid instance
custom validation -> make a method, and add 
errors[:etc] << "Whatever" if it's an error
Then validate :method

belongs_to and has_many associations!

has_many(:toys, {
  primary_key: :id, 
  foreign_key: :dog_id, 
  class_name: :Toy
})

belongs_to(:dogs, {
  primary_key: :id, 
  foreign_key: :dog_id, 
  class_name: :Dog
})

Curly braces and regular braces aren't needed -- implied.
Also, typically, PK/FK/class name is typically implied too.
Associations will create getter and setter methods!

If a house has many dogs and a dog has many toys, how many toys does a house have?
has_many :toys, 
  through: :dogs, # (this is going to be a method or association name)
  source: :toys # (This is also goign to be a method or assocation name)
 
So basically 
1. House will have a toys method 
2. This toys method will call dogs, and dogs will call toys

has_one :house, 
  through: :dog,
  source: :house

With a has_one, there will be a LIMIT 1 added to the query.
--------------------------------------------

Validations are applied at model level 
Constraints are applied at the database level (migrations)

Typical constraints: NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE INDEX
Use both constraints and validation if possible! Ie. NOT NULL + presence: true
Validations happen when save/save! is called

It's important to index columns that are heavily used for lookups in queries! 
Otherwise, a O(n) time complexity per search will happen.
Index = creates sorted data structure(balanced tree) w/ pointers to actual table, then 
lookups can use binary search. Make sure to index the right things, 
and on that note, FOREIGN KEYS are always a good choice because they're used 
in both WHERE clauses and JOINS often.
Use indices if look up on another table or search by that column

In migrations: add_index(:table, :column, unique: true)
Won't allow unique: true unless you have index! 
Also, remember to add complementary model validation if you have database 
unique constraint, meaning in model is uniqueness: true
-----------------------------------------------------
https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/propidx.html

CSS inheritance: takes from nearest ancestor(aka parent container)

CSS RESETS: Change defaults so you don't need to fight against them
Think box-model: width, height, padding, margin, border

margin: 0;
border: 0;
padding: 0;

font: inherit;
text-align: inherit;
text-decoration: inherit;
color: inherit;
background: transparent;

Box-model, font, and color/blackground!

----------------------

In models, you can pass in the object and it'll just be the object's id!

Rails 5 vs Rails 4 
1. in Rails 4 in models, class Cat < ActiveRecord::Base
2. belongs_to associations are automatically validated in Rails 5
3. allows belongs_to associations to be optional w/ optional: true, Rails 5
4. Double errors on belongs_to associations if you validate it again, Rails 5
5. through association ordering-- source last! Rails 5
6. Use render :plain in Rails 5
7. rails replaces rake, rails db:somecommand
8. migrations are versioned in Rails 5
9. shoulda-matchers and rails-controller-testing gems for Rails 5
10. ActionCable, ActiveJob, api_mode, etc in Rails 5

rails new -G means make a project w/o new repo

Helpful development gems: annotate, better_errors, binding_of_caller, byebug,
and pry-rails

Switching from SQlite3 to Postgres is easy 
1. delete .sqlite3 files in db 
2. replace sqlite3 gem with pg gem 
3. bundle install then edit config/database.yml to use postgresql
4. change the default environment 
5. create database and name development/test/production
6. db:create, db:migrate, db:seed. remember bundle exec rails b4 all of those

up, down, and change
rails g migration migration_name
boolean/date/datetime/float/integer/string/text/time

create_table, add_column, remove_column, rename_column, rename_table, 
add_index, change_column

t.timestamps 

rails db:migrate
DO NOT EDIT OLD MIGRATIONS

rails db:schema:load 

Can not only run migrations, but run arbitrary code to fix database or 
populate new fields. .each on a model class!

https://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html

With where-- you can do a lot. Interpolation or ?, an array for IN, a range to 
use BETWEEN, etc.

rails console or rails c -> like pry but loads Ruby application for you and opens 
a connection to the DB. In Rails, use reload! instead of load
For SQL console--use rails dbconsole

belongs_to and has_many -- returning single object vs array

http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/models/relationships.html
Join table implementation! Logical enough. 

N+1 query: Firing DB queries is expensive! Use has_many :through associations 
instead!

has_many :through does not care about the underlying associations-- it could 
literally be anything! belongs_to, has_many, other has_many through, etc. 

has_one is like has_many but LIMIT_1, so it returns object instead of arr

Reflexive Associations: association back to the same table
Two associations to the same class: can specify 

If you don't specify, Rails uses logical defaults which aren't always what 
you want!

Common validators: presence, uniqueness (scope to limit uniqueness check), 
format, length, numericality, inclusion
a.Instead of checking for presence of FK, check presence of associated object!

Common validation options: :allow_nil / :allow_blank, :message, :if, 
:unless, etc 

Primary keys are indexed by definition! Foreign keys and things that will 
be searched for should be indexed

With unique:true constraint, can also pass in array to have the uniqueness 
of a combination fo values

1.rails new <name> -G --database=postgresql 
2.Add in 4 useful gems, bundle install
3.rails db:create
4.Create migrations -> rails g migration <name> -> remember constraints/indexes
  a. Ex. CreateUsers -> users table
5.Create models -> rails g model <name> (can add --migration=false) -> remember 
  validations and associations!
  a. Ex. good_student.rb -> GoodStudent class
6.bundle exec annotate
7.rails console

Important deets to remember: validate presence of the OBJECT, not the key if 
it's a belongs_to. Also, the optional: true tag is useful as well...

list-style and line-height properties 
font-size and vertical-align
width: 100% to take up 100% of width of parent container

bundle exec rails db:setup shorthand create, load, seed

ActiveRecord association represents... 

Think about how prerequisite works for the self reference.
If you use a belongs_to, it'll give what's expected! 
Ruby 101 -> has nil as prereq id, so returns nil 
Ruby 102 -> has Ruby 101's id as prereq id, so returns that

If you did a has_one, it'll return the opposite instead!
Unless you switch up the primary and foreign key...! 

Remember, the first argument is the name of the method then the rest are 
the options hash! Remember Ruby's hash into arguments rule?

launchy gem -> pop open URL in a browser
ctrl - T shortcut to search through project for files

exists? method for ActiveRecord model classes

Rails -> can add Proc to associations, like Proc.new { method }, 
a shortcut for Proc.new is just ->, so -> { method }, works as well. 

Look at how .where and such work in Rails, it's quite cool and convenient.
Also, can write pure SQL using heredocs then
sql = (<<-SQL) SELECT * FROM cats SQL 
ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute(sql)

Rails.cache.clear to clear TMP files
git rm --cached -r <to undo>

#!/usr/bin/env ruby -> Shebang

rails r bin/script, or I'm assuming you could put it anywhere....

find vs find_by vs where

Constraint for uniqueness of two things: add_index :table, [:thing1, :thing2], unique: true
Validation: validates :thing1, uniqueness:  { scope: :thing2 }

Apparently you can't join with outside associations (from other classes)

  def popular_links 
    links
    .joins(:visits)
    .group(:short_url)
    .order("COUNT(visits.id) DESC")
    .limit(5)
    .select("COUNT(*) as num_likes, short_url")
  end

That was hell. Issues -> make sure to reload! and reset, or you won't know 
if you're progressing correctly or not. 

dependent: :destroy is hella useful for taking out associations that rely 
on said thing

associations -> table 
table -> association
What about associaton -> association or table -> table?
Table -> Table is an obvious must, but what about 2 associations?

Seems like you're still kinda confused about GROUP in SQL.
SELECT("table_names.*") so the object pops out!

I believe method chaining -> same order as regular SQL

.destroy_all

rake 
1. rake -t -all to see all tasks
2. invoke by calling <rake task_name>
3. file ends in .rake, with a namespace same as the file name
4. crontab to schedule tasks
5. which rake to find full path

Ex. of myrailsapp.rake file 
namespace :myrailsapp do
  desc "Purge stale entries from audits table"
  task purge_audits: :environment do
    puts "Purging old audits..."
    Audit.purge
  end
end

rake namespace:task_name
